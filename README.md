***WARNING: The data, lexicons, and notebooks all contain content that is racist, sexist, homophobic, and offensive in many other ways.***

You can find our labeled data in the `data` directory. We have included them as a CSV. You will also find a notebook in the `src` directory containing Python 3.5 code to replicate our analyses in the paper and a lexicon in the `lexicons` directory that we 
generated to try to more accurately classify hate speech. The `classifier` directory contains a script, instructions, and the necessary files to run our classifier on new data, a test case is provided.
